title: Example Markdown File format 
tags:
  - YAML 
  - markdown

## Simple
Adding content to the website is a simple as creating a markdown file and adding it to the markdown directory in the root folder of the website. 

## Structure
Every markdown document must obey the following structure. The top of each file must contain the YAML data. Then the markdown must follow (no markdown will result in a blank page). 

## Required YAML 
All documents must have at least the `title` and `tags` elements. Other elements can be added if needed.
